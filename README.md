# Wallet-Clustering
Pattern recognition for wallet clustering

Uses DBSCAN algorithm for clustering wallets

Considers average transaction value, frequency, and activity patterns

Provides cluster statistics

Key components:

1. Core Features:

-Transaction pattern analysis

-Feature extraction from wallet behavior

-Multiple clustering methods (DBSCAN and K-means)

-Pattern recognition in clusters

-Visualization capabilities

-Detailed cluster analysis



2. Wallet Features Analyzed:

-Transaction volumes and frequencies

-Value patterns

-Temporal patterns (time-of-day, frequency)

-Network metrics (unique contacts)

-Transaction value ratios



3. Analysis Capabilities:

-Automatic pattern detection

-Cluster characterization

-Interactive visualizations

-Model persistence
